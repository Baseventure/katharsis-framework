Goals of this project
=====================
Per other discussions, I created a package for a default UI. It's nothing more than that though: a package.

I wanted to create this issue so we can talk about how to proceed.

Key features (I think):

1. May be picked up a maven dependency and served up as `/index.html` so that you can immediately begin interacting with it
2. It would be nice is it was friendly to other languages and tools -- that way the UI can be picked up even in a non-java environment (would this mean multi module? Multi build (mvn, npm))
